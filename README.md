# Variable-Power-Supply

Problem Statement:-
Design and simulate a variable power supply which takes an AC input of 230V rms at 50 Hz and gives a DC output that can vary in the range of 0-30V and maximum output load current should be 1-1.5A. 

Project Report requirements:-

1. Circuit Design:-  
a. Block Diagram: This part will consist of a properly labelled block diagram showing the complete power supply design and highlighting all the main blocks in the circuit.
b. Design Explanation: In this part a detailed explanation will be given about the working of each block and role of all circuit components used in each block. 
c. Design Calculation: All the designed values of each circuit component along withtheir (handwritten) calculations should be given in this part. Any assumptions made should also be highlighted.

2. Circuit Simulation:- 
a. Circuit diagram: Attach a properly labelled screenshot of the simulated circuit. 
b. Results: Show the results of the variable voltage output. 
c. Input and output waveforms: Attach the waveforms for the input and output voltages. 

3. Conclusion/comments:-
This part will discuss the results and how they compare with the desired output. Also, add any assumptions taken, and improvements for the design.
